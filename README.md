# Elyzha's little things 
My repository is about the little things in life that make me happy. 

## Bio
*2023 is my turn to grow.* My name is Elyzha and I am a Filipino-American from Seattle, WA. I have an interest in UX Design and creating products that are accessible to all users. 

I have always sought out to be the best that I can be academically. As I grew up, I also faced different obstacles that hindered my mindset into reaching the goals that I wanted to achieve. This year, I'm ready to take calculated risks to take new responsibilities to see how far I can go professionally and as an individual.
